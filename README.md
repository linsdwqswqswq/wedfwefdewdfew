Common vinyl shower curtains release chemical gases and odors from their ingredients and are manufactured with non-renewable and chemical products. They are difficult to clean and end up in a landfill where they don't biodegrade and potentially release dangerous substances into the aquifer. The alternative that we like the best is a hemp shower curtain found at  Hemp is naturally <a href=http://www.cnusfrtnk.com>air jordan pas cher</a> resistant to mold and bacteria and it is also quick drying which means it won't trap moisture in the tub like those vinyl liners that only add to mold growth which is hard to clean and certainly disgusting. I imagine that most people just throw the old ones away rather than clean them. This curtain will get wet, but it will not leak through. This means that no liner is even needed.
